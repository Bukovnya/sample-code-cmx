DevX Feedback Log
============================

1. CMX is really an interesting platform to play around with the ideas dealing with location and tracking. People inside Cisco could easily get a chance to explore this technology as they can easily get the set up. But for the users who are trying to use the sandbox CMX set up, it is  actually an issue right now and in future should deliver the same services as CMX set up inside the Cisco environment gives.

2. CMX Sandbox is working fine but response time is too large.
